## Prompts d'illustration

### Image principale (à insérer dans le template)

**Prompt 1 - Résultats tangibles**
```
A photorealistic image, no text. A satisfied business team celebrating small wins in a modern office. Three managers looking at improved KPIs on a screen or dashboard, smiling and discussing results. Documents showing process improvements and productivity metrics are visible on the table. The atmosphere is positive and results-oriented. Natural lighting, professional setting in Eastern France. Style: authentic business success photography, warm tones, candid moment.
```

**Prompt 2 - Avant/Après organisation (alternatif)**
```
A photorealistic image, no text. Split-screen visual concept showing transformation: on one side, a cluttered, disorganized desk with too many papers and chaotic post-its; on the other side, the same desk now clean, organized with clear labeled folders, digital tools visible, minimal and efficient. The contrast shows the impact of productivity training. Style: high-quality business photography, clean aesthetic, natural lighting.
