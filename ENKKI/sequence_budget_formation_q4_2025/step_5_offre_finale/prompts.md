**Prompt - Urgence dernières places**
```
A photorealistic image, no text. A professional training room setup ready for a session, with chairs arranged for exactly 12 participants. Some chairs are occupied by business professionals, while a few remain empty, conveying the "last seats available" concept. The room is modern, well-lit with natural light. Training materials, flip charts, and a welcome setup are visible. The atmosphere is professional and inviting, but conveys scarcity. Style: high-quality corporate photography, warm professional tones, emphasis on limited availability.
