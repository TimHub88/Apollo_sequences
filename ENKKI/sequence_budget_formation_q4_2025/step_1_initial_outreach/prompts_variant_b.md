A photorealistic image, no text. A professional training facilitator presenting a structured program to attentive business professionals in a modern training room. A flip chart or digital screen shows organized content modules. Participants (8-10 people, diverse ages and genders) are seated in a semi-circle, engaged and taking notes. The setting is bright, modern, and professional. Natural lighting from large windows. The Vosges mountains are softly visible in the background. Style: high-quality corporate training photography, warm professional atmosphere.

A photorealistic image, no text. Close-up of professional training materials on a clean desk: a branded program brochure opened showing modules and calendar, a tablet displaying formation details, colorful sticky notes, a quality pen, and a cup of coffee. The materials look organized and practical. Natural window light creates a professional yet approachable atmosphere. Style: flat lay photography, warm tones, high-quality business aesthetic, shallow depth of field on background.
