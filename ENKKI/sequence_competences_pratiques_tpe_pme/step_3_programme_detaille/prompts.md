**Prompt - 4 piliers formation**
```
A photorealistic image, no text. A visual metaphor showing four distinct professional skills areas: marketing materials and local communication tools, productivity and organization systems (calendars, processes), leadership and team management symbols, and digital/social media devices. These four elements are arranged harmoniously on a modern workspace. The scene conveys a complete, holistic approach to business skills development. Style: high-quality corporate photography, clean composition, warm professional tones.
