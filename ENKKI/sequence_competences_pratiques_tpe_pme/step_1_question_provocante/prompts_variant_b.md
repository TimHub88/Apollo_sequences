### Image principale

**Prompt - Contraste formations**
```
A photorealistic image, no text. Split visual concept showing two contrasting training scenarios: On the left, a boring traditional classroom with a lecturer in front of a PowerPoint, participants looking disengaged and bored, thick theoretical manuals on desks. On the right, an engaging, interactive workshop with participants actively working, using laptops and tools, collaborating, trainer facilitating (not lecturing). The contrast shows theory vs. practice. Style: high-quality corporate photography, natural lighting, clear visual storytelling.
