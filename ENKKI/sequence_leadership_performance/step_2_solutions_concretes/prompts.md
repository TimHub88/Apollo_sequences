**Prompt - Outils management pratiques**
```
A photorealistic image, no text. A clean, organized workspace showing various practical management tools laid out: a 1-on-1 meeting template on a tablet, a delegation matrix chart, feedback forms, a team cohesion dashboard on a laptop screen, meeting agenda templates. Everything is modern, professional, and clearly actionable - not theoretical. Natural lighting, bird's eye view angle. Style: high-quality business photography, clean aesthetic, focus on practical tools and templates.
