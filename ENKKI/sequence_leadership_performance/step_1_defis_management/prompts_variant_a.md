**Prompt - Défis management moderne**
```
A photorealistic image, no text. A modern manager (35-45 years old) looking thoughtful while leading a diverse hybrid team. Some team members are present in a modern office, others visible on laptop screens (remote work). The scene shows the complexity of modern management: different generations, hybrid work, various communication tools. The manager appears focused but challenged. Natural lighting, authentic corporate setting. Style: high-quality business photography, candid moment, warm professional tones, focus on modern workplace complexity.
