**Prompt - Transformation management**
```
A photorealistic image, no text. A before/after conceptual scene: On one side, a stressed manager with a demotivated team, people looking away or disengaged. On the other side, the same manager now confident and smiling, leading an engaged and collaborative team, everyone working together positively. The transformation is clear and impactful. Natural lighting, modern office setting. Style: high-quality business photography, compelling visual storytelling, warm professional tones, focus on positive transformation.
