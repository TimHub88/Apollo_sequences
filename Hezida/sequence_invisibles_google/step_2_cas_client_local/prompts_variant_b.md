### Image principale

**Prompt 1 - Artisan réalisant son erreur**
```
A photorealistic image, no text. A thoughtful electrician (35-50 years old) in his workshop, sitting at a desk with a laptop open. He's looking at his computer screen with a surprised, slightly concerned expression, as if he just discovered something important. On the screen, we can see a Google search results page where competitor businesses are listed but his is not. Workshop tools and equipment visible in the blurred background. The lighting is natural and slightly dramatic. Style: documentary-style business photography capturing a moment of realization.
```

**Prompt 2 - Invisible vs visible (alternatif)**
```
A photorealistic image, no text. A conceptual split image. Left side: an empty phone on a desk, silent, no notifications. Right side: the same phone but with multiple call and message notifications popping up. In the background of both sides, we see the shadow/silhouette of an artisan. The contrast represents the difference between being invisible online and being found by customers. Moody, professional lighting. Style: modern conceptual business photography.
