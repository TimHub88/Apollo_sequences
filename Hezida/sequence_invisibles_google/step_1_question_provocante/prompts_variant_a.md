### Image principale (à insérer dans le template)

**Prompt 1 - Recherche Google locale**
```
A photorealistic image, no text. A close-up view of hands holding a smartphone, typing a search query on Google. The screen shows a Google search results page for "menuisier Épinal" or "plombier Vosges" with several local business listings visible. The background is slightly blurred, showing a modern office or home environment. Natural lighting. The image conveys the idea of local customers searching for artisans online. Style: clean, modern, professional photography with warm tones. Focus on the smartphone screen and hands.
```

**Prompt 2 - Artisan invisible (alternatif)**
```
A photorealistic split-screen image, no text. Left side: a talented artisan (carpenter, plumber, or electrician) working skillfully in their workshop, looking professional and competent. Right side: an empty Google search results page on a computer monitor with "No results found" or competitors listed. The contrast shows the frustration of being invisible online despite having real skills. Dramatic lighting. Style: modern business photography with a hint of dramatic storytelling.
