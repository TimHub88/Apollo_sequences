### Image principale (à insérer dans le template)

**Prompt 1 - Comparaison artisan visible vs invisible**
```
A photorealistic image, no text. A modern, clean split-screen composition. Left side: a happy artisan (plumber, carpenter, or electrician) in their workshop receiving a phone call from a customer, smiling. In the background, a computer screen shows their website ranking #1 on Google. Right side: another skilled artisan looking frustrated, phone silent, empty workshop. Contrast between success and struggle in the digital age for local businesses. Professional lighting, warm tones on the left, cooler tones on the right. Style: contemporary business photography with storytelling.
```

**Prompt 2 - Client cherchant artisan local (alternatif)**
```
A photorealistic image, no text. An overhead shot of a customer in their home office, laptop open showing a Google Maps search for "menuisier Épinal" with pins and local business listings visible on the map. The person's hand is hovering over the mouse, about to click on one of the top-ranked businesses. A notepad and phone are visible on the desk. The scene conveys the moment of decision when a customer chooses which local artisan to contact. Natural window lighting, clean modern aesthetic. Style: high-quality lifestyle photography.
