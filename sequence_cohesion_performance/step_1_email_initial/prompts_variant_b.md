### Image 1 : √âquipe travaillant ensemble mais silot√©e
**Position dans le template :** Apr√®s la citation du DRH

**Prompt en anglais :**
```
A photorealistic image showing a divided office workspace. The scene depicts 3-4 small groups of employees working separately in different areas of an open office. Each group is focused on their own tasks, with visible physical and psychological distance between groups. Some people are on laptops, others on phones, but there's no interaction between the groups. Natural lighting, modern office environment. The image should convey the concept of workplace silos - people in the same company but not communicating. Realistic business attire, subtle body language showing disconnection despite proximity. Professional photography style with natural colors.

**Position dans le template :** Apr√®s la section "Programme"

A breathtaking photorealistic landscape of the Vosges mountains in France.

Autumn or late summer season with rich colors. Wide-angle landscape photography style, sharp focus throughout, conveying tranquility and natural beauty.
